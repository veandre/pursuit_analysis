# pursuit_analysis
image tracking, flight reconstruction, body orientation


Hello,
During my thesis I studied how a male fly follows in flight a dummy target whose trajectory is controlled by computer. 

In the project pursuit_analysis I present the Matlab toolbox I've developed during this project. It is a MATLAB GUI which helps the user to analyse the aerial pursuit. 

Prerequisites:
Tracking scene recorded by 2 stereocameras whose films are synchronized and named LEFT and RIGHT.
